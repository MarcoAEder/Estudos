Alfred the Great (AElfred 848/849 â€“ 26 October 899) was King of the West Saxons from 871 to c. 886 and King of the Anglo-Saxons from c. 886 until his death in 899. He was the youngest son of King AEthelwulf and his first wife Osburh, who both died when Alfred was young. Three of Alfred's brothers, AEthelbald, AEthelberht and AEthelred, reigned in turn before him. Under Alfred's rule, considerable administrative and military reforms were introduced, prompting lasting change in England.
